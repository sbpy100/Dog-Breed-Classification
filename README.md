# Dog-Breed-Classification
Dog-Breed Classification  Using Deep Learning
1. Developed a Dog Breed Classification system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), specifically leveraging MobileNetV2 architecture.
2. Trained the model on a dataset comprising over 10,000 images of various dog breeds, achieving an impressive accuracy of approximately 95%.
3. Implemented image preprocessing techniques and data augmentation to enhance model generalization and robustness.
4. Utilized transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model, significantly reducing training time and resource requirements.
5. Integrated the model into a user-friendly web application, allowing users to upload images of dogs and receive accurate predictions of their breeds.
6. Employed Flask framework for backend development and created an intuitive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
7. Conducted rigorous testing and validation procedures to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the classification system.
8. Documented the project's methodology, including model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics, for clear understanding and reproducibility.
9. Received positive feedback from users, highlighting the system's high accuracy and ease of use in identifying dog breeds from images.
10. Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills and proficiency in machine learning techniques through successful completion of the project.
